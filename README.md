# House Price Predictor 🏠📊

This project focuses on predicting house prices using the multilinear regression algorithm. Multilinear regression is a powerful technique for modeling the relationship between multiple independent variables (features) and a dependent variable (target), making it suitable for predicting house prices based on various factors.

## Objective 🎯
The primary goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that accurately estimates the price of a house given its features such as size, number of bedrooms, location, amenities, etc. By leveraging multilinear regression, we can analyze the relationships between these features and the house prices to make accurate predictions.

## Project Components ⚙️
1. **Data Collection**: Gathering comprehensive data on house prices and their corresponding features from reliable sources such as real estate databases, websites, or APIs.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preprocessing the collected data to handle missing values, outliers, and categorical variables. This may involve feature scaling, encoding categorical variables, and feature selection.

3. **Model Training**: Training a multilinear regression model using the preprocessed data. This involves fitting the model to the training data to learn the relationships between features and house prices.

4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating the trained model's performance using appropriate metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), etc.

5. **Deployment**: Deploying the trained model to make predictions accessible to users. This can be done through a web application, API, or any other suitable platform.

## Usage 🧑‍💻
1. **Data Collection**: Upload the relevant dataset.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the collected data to prepare it for model training.
3. **Model Training**: Train a multilinear regression model using the preprocessed data.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the trained model's performance using appropriate evaluation metrics.
5. **Deployment**: Deploy the trained model to make predictions available to users (web app coming soon).
